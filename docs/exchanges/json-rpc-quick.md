# What is RPC?

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that allows one program to request a service from software located on another computer network without having to understand all of the networkâ€™s details. A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call.

By replacing dedicated protocols and communication methods with a standardized interface, RPC is designed to facilitate communication between client and server processes. The functions contained within RPC are accessible by any program that must communicate using a client/server methodology.

::: tip
The majority of platforms utilising bitcoin use this RPC procedure. To accommodate these services and make the integration of Ark as user friendly as possible, it was our goal to develop a familiar process for use now, and in the future. The Ark RPC will minimise headaches and streamline the addition process for all.

# JSON-RPC Quick Actions

## Setup

All JSON-RPC implementations should be built using the tools of your programming language of choice. A working code implementation is provided below in NodeJS, but the same principles can be applied to the language of your choice 

By default, the JSON-API listens on port 8080 for requests. This means that all JSON-RPC interactions should be POST requests to the URL `http://YOUR.NODE.IP:8080`, with the IP address of your node combined with the JSON-RPC port number.

If you're having trouble connecting, your JSON-RPC may be disabled. To enable it, log into your node and add the key `ARK_JSON_RPC_ENABLED=true` to the ***.env*** file in your config directory. 

Your config directory is located at `~/.ark` by default. If the .env file does not exist, create it, then restart your node to apply your changes.

In addition, all request should include the HTTP header `Content-Type: application/json`. This tells the Ark Core node that your request body is formatted as JSON, which is necessary to use all JSON-RPC endpoints.

Each quick action will interact with the JSON-RPC in the same way - unless noted otherwise, any of these actions can be accessed with the following code:
```js
const axios = require('axios') // install from npm with `npm install axios`
const url = "http://YOUR.NODE.IP:8080" // http://${NODE_ID}:${JSON-RPC-PORT}
const headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

const body = {} // this object is unique to each method described below

axios.post(url, body, headers)
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.result)
  }
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error)	
  })
```
Note that the `url` variable should be replaced with the location and port number of your Ark Core node. 

To complete the template, replace the empty `body` object with the objects provided in each quick action. The `blocks.latest` method, for example, can be accessed by the following script:
```js
const axios = require('axios') // install from npm with `npm install axios`
const url = "http://YOUR.NODE.IP:8080" // http://${NODE_ID}:${JSON-RPC-PORT}
const headers = {
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

const body = {
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: "blocks.latest", 
  id: 31 // internal ID to track responses
} 

axios.post(url, body, headers)
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data)
  }
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error)	
  })
```
## Check Wallet Balance

This method can be used to check the account balance associated with a particular Ark address. To utilize it, use the following body payload:
```js
const body = {
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: "wallets.info", 
  id: 31 // internal ID to track responses
  params: {
    address: "AMv3iLrvyvpi6d4wEfLqX8kzMxaRvxAcHT" // the address you want to query
  }
}
```
The response will contain the `jsonrpc` and `id` you used to call the request, along with a payload containing the following data:
```js
{
  "address": "AMv3iLrvyvpi6d4wEfLqX8kzMxaRvxAcHT",
  "balance": 245098210000000,
  "isDelegate": true,
  "publicKey": "02532c68cd0842fb86b2202c1027eafc741bdd581517047d9d19319e6741c54883",
  "secondPublicKey": nil,
  "username": "genesis_30"
}
```
## Find Block Information

If you want to retrieve the latest block on the blockchain, call the `blocks.latest` method with no parameters:
```js
const body = {
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: "blocks.latest", 
  id: 31 // internal ID to track responses
}
```
This returns a response similar to the following:
```js
{
  "forged": {
    "amount": 0, 
    "fee": 0, 
    "reward": 0, 
    "total": 0
  },
  "generator": {
    "address": "AdWRsk7Lbo97jxGBKzLAFwevVHbqVbW1Cj",
    "publicKey": "03691178f8610d0a295e650201b62345056c788d7f9ac7e8570b69c6c90091b564",
    "username": "genesis_8"
  },
  "height": 20582,
  "id": "5897025410627682852",
  "payload": {
    "hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",

    "unix": 1545003970
  },
  "transactions": 0,
  "version": 0
}
```
## Create and Broadcast Transactions

Creating a transaction using the JSON-RPC is a two-step process:

1. Create the transaction object with `transactions.create`.
2. Broadcast the transaction to the network with `transactions.broadcast`.

The `transactions.create` endpoint accepts three parameters:

- RecipientId
- Amount
- Passphrase

An example transaction creation payload could look like this:
```js
const body = {
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: "transactions.create", 
  id: 31
  params: {
    recipientId: "AMv3iLrvyvpi6d4wEfLqX8kzMxaRvxAcHT" // the address you want to query,
    amount: "200000000", // 2 ARK * 100,000,000 arktoshi/ARK
    passphrase: "craft imitate step mixture patch forest volcano business charge around girl confirm"
  }
}
```
This endpoint will return a transaction object similar to the following:
```js
{
  "amount": "200000000",
  "fee": 10000000,
  "id": "b60525042509586151fac7e3c70fe7a75ca00ffdf9988f20d0c1c0f3db798e86",
  "recipientId": "AMv3iLrvyvpi6d4wEfLqX8kzMxaRvxAcHT",
  "senderPublicKey": "038082dad560a22ea003022015e3136b21ef1ffd9f2fd50049026cbe8e2258ca17",
  "signature": "304402204236a59a19266b5969e18f87d6d4b178180277c79beb5d4b42f272ee03fba0b702200c6c97ed5ab2e6231f3dce5cdfe740e72261b460f896fb4c5be0ca7ce6244c67",
  "timestamp": 54903765,
  "type": 0
}
```
Importantly, this does **not** mean your transaction has been added to the blockchain! To do so, we'll need to submit a second request to `transactions.broadcast`. 

This request should have a `params` object with a single key: the `id` key returned by `transactions.create`.

Using the returned ID, our second request body looks like this:
```js
const body = {
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: "transactions.broadcast", 
  id: 31
  params: {
    id: "b60525042509586151fac7e3c70fe7a75ca00ffdf9988f20d0c1c0f3db798e86"
  }
}
```
If we receive the same transaction object as the call to `transactions.create`, our transaction was successful. Within your application, one way to confirm the result is to check that `result.id` matches the transaction ID you provided to the endpoint.

Otherwise, the `errors` key will contain more information on what went wrong.

## Check Transaction Confirmations

Checking the number of confirmations a transaction has can be done via JSON-RPC by the `transactions.info` method.

The command accepts one parameter: the `id` of the transaction to query. A sample request could look like:
```js
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: "transactions.info",
  id: 9,
  params: {
    id: "b60525042509586151fac7e3c70fe7a75ca00ffdf9988f20d0c1c0f3db798e86"
  }
}
```
If successful, you'll receive a response similar to the following:
```js
{
  "amount": 200000000,
  "blockId": "16888082711050311577",
  "confirmations": 27,
  "fee": 10000000,
  "id": "b60525042509586151fac7e3c70fe7a75ca00ffdf9988f20d0c1c0f3db798e86",
  "recipient": "AMv3iLrvyvpi6d4wEfLqX8kzMxaRvxAcHT",
  "sender": "ARAibxGqLQJTo1bWMJfu5fCc88rdWWjqgv",
  "signature": "304402204236a59a19266b5969e18f87d6d4b178180277c79beb5d4b42f272ee03fba0b702200c6c97ed5ab2e6231f3dce5cdfe740e72261b460f896fb4c5be0ca7ce6244c67",
  "timestamp": {
    "epoch": 54903765,
    "human": "2018-12-17T00:02:45.000Z",
    "unix": 1545004965
  },
  "type": 0,
  "version": 1
}
```
This particular transaction has 27 confirmations, meaning you can be confident that this transaction has been irreversibly included in the blockc
